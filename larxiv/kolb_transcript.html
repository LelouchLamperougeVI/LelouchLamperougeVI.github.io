<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span lang=EN-US>An
Interview with Bryan<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The following is a transcript of an
interview conducted with Dr. Bryan E. Kolb on November 9<sup>th</sup>, 2022.
Dr. Kolb is a Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge. Over
his career, he has made substantial contributions to both neuroscience,
psychology and the Department of Neuroscience at the University. These include
the writing of the first textbook on neuropsychology, demonstrating that the
rat indeed has a prefrontal cortex that is functionally similar to that of
primates, the establishment of the graduate programme at the University, and
many more.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The interviewer, HaoRan Chang, is a PhD
candidate serving as the editor of the departmental newsletter at the time of
the interview. The purpose of the interview was to gather materials for a
biographical article in light of Dr. Kolb’s recent announcement to retire by
the end of the school semestre. Over the course of the interview, many
interesting topics were covered, including the history of our department, the
history of neuroscience, advice for scholars at all stages of their careers and
many stirring historical anecdotes. Dr. Kolb’s down-to-earth attitude also
imparted a personal touch to the conversation, unlikely to be conveyed through
other mediums. The interviewer therefore compiled the present transcript, with
the hope of that future students at the Canadian Centre for Behavioural
Neuroscience may be inspired by this legend as much as this interviewer has
been.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The full interview was over two hours long,
and presented here in raw details, with edits made only for clarity. A few
sensitive pieces of information have been redacted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1 (HaoRan Chang)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I was researching for potential questions
to ask and before I knew it, I had 3 pages worth of questions, so please feel
free to let me know if it's getting too long.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2 (Bryan Kolb)</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No problem. I'm only gonna retire from here
once.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, that's true. Well, in that case
let's just kick things off with... well, first I was on your Wikipedia page and
I'm not too sure how accurate the information is obviously.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, obviously I didn't write it. You
can't write your own right? Megan wrote it. And there are a couple of little
errors, but they're not important.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, just to confirm things, so it says on
the Wikipedia article that you became interested in science at a very young
age, but at the same time you struggled a little bit with English and history.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Not history. Yeah, that's correct. Not
history. That, I don't know where she got that from. But with English for sure.
I know that from the grades. We used to have what are called departmental exams
and you had in grade 9 and in grade 12 and they still have them in grade 12.
And in grade 9, I think we wrote seven of them, and I had six A’s and one C and
the C was in English. And in grade 12, it was the same kind of deal. I pretty
much had all honours and then I had, I think, 65 in English. I mean I did better
in French than in English. Then in university, we had to take first year
English course. Full year course on History of English language. And I got 50.
I lost my scholarship. So, everything else was A and I got 50. So, the irony of
all of this is: I write books.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, yeah, which is fascinating. And
we’re gonna come back to the books. I mean, I guess once you start practising
things start coming together. So, then you subsequently did your masters and
bachelors at the UofC in psychology. Out of all the scientific topics that
could have interested you, why did you pick neuroscience/psychology?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, neuroscience didn't really exist at
the time. So, I had finished my masters in basically animal behaviour. That was
in psychology. But I really thought that the key to understanding our behaviour
was understanding what was producing it. And so, I thought that interleaves into
physiological psychology. The person that I went to work with, Mike Warren,
studied animal learning of behaviour and brain stuff. And so, I thought that
would be a good fit. So, I wrote to him, and he took me. Penn State, that's why
I went there. To do that, I had to give up my NSERC because you couldn't take
it across the border. And I reapplied for it once I got there. And I've got it
the next year. So it was, because I was interested in how behaviour was being
produced, naively of course. And then once I got involved in it, I was hooked.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, so were you inspired by some early investigators,
like say, by Sherrington or Lashley or ...?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Lashley, for sure. Sherrington not so much
because it was basic Physiology, but Lashley was doing similar kinds of things.
I remember I was trying to decide what I would do. So, in the US, what often happens
is you're given the PhD topic, and Mike gave me a topic which I did not want to
do. And I told him that. He never had a student do that before who said, “I
don't want to do this”. So, he asked, “What do you want to do?” I said, “I
don't know”. And so, I remember being in the grad bullpen and there were only
two of us in there. It was pretty empty, but we had journals in there, and I
was looking at Brain Research, which was a new journal at that time. And there
was an article, by Christiana Leonard, that argued that the rat, anatomically
at least, had a prefrontal cortex. And so, I thought, if that's true, then we
should be able to demonstrate that it's got the same symptoms [following
lesion], or something like it as monkeys. Yeah, so that's what I decided to do.
Just based on her article. She knows this. I've told her that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That's awesome, because for me who joined the
field relatively recently, it came as such a big surprise to learn that back in
your days, the prefrontal cortex, whether or not rats had it, was even offered
up for debates, right? Because there's so much literature on the prefrontal in
rats.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Of course, so my stuff was the first... I
had a series of papers from my thesis. And then had a review in 84, which is
still being read by people. Amazingly, because it's pretty pretty old now.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, I actually just read it yesterday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh, OK. And it was Mike who refused to sign
my thesis because he didn't believe the conclusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sounds like a familiar story [chuckle].</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That rats had prefrontal cortex that was functionally
subdivided, much like the primate. He just wasn't about to believe it. And so,
I remember sitting out in the hall; we had the oral and the oral was fine. Sitting
out the hall forever and the chair came out and said, “well, we have a problem
here and that is your supervisor doesn't want to sign your thesis because he
doesn't believe your thesis” and I said, “well, he doesn't have to. It's my idea”.
My argument is this and I have all these, all the data. And we all agree, he
doesn't. And so, I remember saying to him, “Well I've got a problem. I have to
teach in 10 minutes.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Teaching what?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Teaching intro psych, and that was a
requirement there that you had to teach Intro Psych as part of your graduation
requirements for PhD. And it was good experience. And so, then when I came back
from the class. But I don't think my heart was really in the class because I
was thinking about what was gonna happen. Well, the chair caught me and he said,
“well, he finally relented and agreed. But he doesn't believe it.” And what was
interesting is that he had been on sabbatical in Cambridge and he came back for
my thesis and somebody else's thesis, orals. And the woman who had hers the day
before, she failed. She couldn't answer questions and so on, but I didn't know what
was the reason she failed. All I knew was that she failed, and I thought people
don't fail. You get to that point [of defending], but Mike was not around when
I did a lot of the thesis. He was in England and so he only got it the night
before. Everybody agreed that they saw me put it in the mail. He never got it.
Well, he did not have much time to consider my claim. And so he wrote me a
letter from England when he got back and apologised. And said, “I think the
reason that I was so against it wasn't your conclusion. But it was the best
thesis any student of mine had done and I had nothing to do with it”. And so,
we sort of mended fences after and we became friends. That was sort of a rocky
start, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You can say that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But the same thing was true about posterior
parietal cortex. That it wasn't believed [that rats had one]. So, our series of
papers on that in the early 80s. And actually, do you know John?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>John Walkey?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, so he was an undergraduate and his
name is on the very first paper, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, do you actually remember the topic
that Michael Warren assigned you initially?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, he wanted me to study learning in
hamsters. And to go after a theory. A guy in England, his name [inaudible]. He
was a big shot at the time and had a theory of learning. [inaudible]. I don't
know why it was hamsters, but the hamster would be because he didn't like rats.
Our building was a cat facility. We had 220 cats or something and I don't know
6 monkeys and no rodents. And so, he wanted me to go after this theory and he
had all these ideas. Well, that didn't have a whole lot to do with the brain,
which is what I read. He was interested in pursuing...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, how does that relate to [inaudible] a
lot of electrophysiology back then was done in cats. So, for sure there was a
lot of potential there for physiological psychology, I guess. So why did you
pick rats specifically when it wasn't really available?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, because. Disposition, if you like, of
the cats. The way the cats were assigned to me. There was only one cat available
for me if I wanted to do cats. Unfortunately for me that cat got bladder stones
and died and so there weren't any and so. We had a lot of cats, but they were
all in projects and I was actually testing cats for Mike in some learning
studies, quick reaction learning studies, but they were not to be assigned for
lesion studies. And there was a lot of Physiology work going on in the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, actually yes. From reading your
early, well, I should say throughout your career, lesion has been one of the
main topics of research, right? But then both you and Ian have studied under Case
Vanderwolf for your postdoc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was his PhD. It was my postdoc.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh right, yeah, sorry. Case is one of the
Pioneers for EEG recordings for studying neurophysiology of sleep and
behaviour. So, did this experience not “sway” you to join the systems
neuroscience camp? So, I'm kind of thinking of Buzsaki who also worked with Case.
Back then, systems neuro was slowly emerging as one of the most popular topics.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>OK. So, I did EEG for two years and again
there was lesions involved because I was trying to get rid of theta. Trying to figure
out where it was coming from. Obviously, it’s coming from the hippocampus,
that's [where we’ve] been recording it, but what other structures were tied in?
So, I made lesions all over the place and if you make it in the lateral
hypothalamus, you can slow it down, right? And we knew that there were two
kinds of theta because Case had shown atropine sensitive and not sensitive, and
so we could [still observe] atropine sensitive [theta] with those lesions too, we
couldn't really get rid of it. It was just there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, so back then, the projections from
medial septum were not really known?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, if you did, if you knocked out the septum,
you got rid of theta. Yeah, that was the only thing that [worked] and I don't
know how much you know about rats with septal lesions, but you don't want to be
hooking up [electrodes in them] because they are nasty. They are, oh yeah,
they're really angry.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh really? Oh, because I worked with septal
mice as well. So, we were doing opto inhibition of medial septum in my previous
lab and then, at least on the surface, it didn't seem to affect the behaviour
too much, but we were able to silence theta. Yeah, so maybe there's some other
specific pathways in there, yeah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Could be. So, I and Ian. So, Ian was doing
stuff here on lesions and so, we wrote a paper. It's in Experimental Neurology,
78 or something. Putting all this stuff together, on these lesions. I met Ian
when I was in first year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In your undergrad, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yes, in undergrad. Ian was a special
student in the sense that he had a degree in English and he was taking
psychology courses. Because he had discovered physiological psychology, and so
we sat side by side in statistics. And we people tend to sit in the same place
all the time, and so he didn't look like he was eight years older. I mean, he
still doesn't, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>[Chuckle]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And so, I got to know him and then I
started working in a different lab that he was working in, but he was still
there all the time, so that's how I got to know him early on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, your time with Vanderwolf did not
overlap, right? Yeah, if given the right excuse, I would also love to interview
Whishaw. He also has such a fabulous career. So, it would be quite interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He claims that I ruined it. Yeah, because
when I came, he'd like to play a lot of tennis in the summer. And he kept
saying, “what are you doing here?” I'm doing all his experiments and so he
said, “You ruined my summers. I could no longer play tennis, I had to work.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, that's interesting. Well for sure you
picked his interest, I guess. So, for your second postdoc, you worked with
Brenda Milner at the MNI. So, after spending most of your early career laying
down the foundations for rat lesion studies, why did you decide to switch to
human research?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I didn't decide. I was unemployable. In
1975, after finishing my postdoc with Case, nobody wanted to hire people who do
lesions, you had to be doing hormones or electrophysiology. That's where people
thought the future [was]. And so, I was applying for jobs at the City of
Calgary and so on, and Case, his wife, Doreen Kimura, said “this is ridiculous”
and she said, “I'm going to arrange for you to go to work with Brenda at the
MNI”. And I was reluctant. Because I knew nothing about human brain. Turns out
nobody did, but I didn't know. And so. But, I had met Brenda. Well, she visited
Western, so I knew her sort of as a visiting speaker and she talks to the
postdocs and students, but we weren't certainly friends. I don’t think she
could have picked me out of the lineup. And but anyway. We went there. We met
my now former wife and I went there. It changed everything and changed my life
completely for two reasons. One was, when I arrived I said to the students,
there were no other postdocs at that time. I said to the students, “what do you
read?” And their response was, “there's nothing to read”. And I said, “well,
there's gotta be a book on human brain and how it works”. And so, no, there
isn't. And I said, “well, there’s a whole library upstairs at the neuro”. So, I
went up there and I found one book in French by Henry Hécaen. And it was on
aphasia, apraxia and agnosia. But it really wasn't enlightening. And you know,
it was in French, my French was better than it is now. And I just thought no
this isn't it yet. So, I thought, how is it that you learn stuff? You teach it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, I thought, why don't I make up a
course, right? And so, I did that. I talked to all of the Neurologists,
neurosurgeons, psychologists in the building. And ask them, “what one paper
should I read?” And I got a list of papers that were all different. So, I read
them and made a course based on those papers. And then I went to see Peter
Milner who was a chair of psychology, that I want to put on a course called
human neuropsychology. He laughed and said, “That's ridiculous. There's no such
field and nobody would take it.” And I said, “well, how many [students] would
you need?”, and I think he said eight, but he might have said six, a small
number of students. And he said, “OK, well, you won't be teaching it
[inaudible] no one [will] signed up for it”. He taught brain and behaviour
which was called physiological psychology [back then, and the class only had]
20 [students]. So, there really wasn't much interest. So meanwhile, as time
went on, I began to realise, you know, this is really a course that people
would like. So, I sent the course outline in a letter to every university in
Canada, saying this is the future. I really think that this is a course and so
on. And I ended [up going from people] having no interest in me before, and
having published no papers in this field --- I think I had 7 or 8 publications
from my PhD, but my vitae was the same, the letterhead was different, I was at
the neuro and not at Western --- [to] all of a sudden started getting
responses. So eventually I ended up coming here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And I think one of the questions you have
is why I came here and to explain that. I had an offer at Western, at Manitoba,
at Alberta and here. And so I went to see Peter and said, “well, we can forget
about the course because I'm leaving”. He said, “you can't”. And I said, “why?”
And he said, “175 students signed up for the course”. And I just went [away]. I
[was] right, he couldn't believe it. So, they had to hire somebody and bring
him in from England to teach the course because there were a lot of bums in the
seats. But some of the topics. That person, his name is [Brightcliffe?]. He
really didn't know much about it and so I would fly back and give those
lectures to the class.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Moving ahead, why did I come here? Well, we
had lived in State College, PA, which is a small town. It's a university town.
That's all it is. And I liked living in a small town. And I did not like living
in Montreal. You lived in Montreal, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I grew up in Montreal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You grew up in Montreal. We lived in
Outremont, which was certainly not anglophone. And it was not a bad place to
live. It was not a small town. You can't park anywhere. The driving is
horrible. I often would walk to work. In winter I took the bus because it was
too slushy and miserable. But my wife went to McGill. She started university.
But I just couldn't see living there. I also was in Albertan. And wanted to
come back West. And so. What actually happened was, when I interviewed here,
there wasn't a job here. But there was a guy who had decided to leave and
become a clinical psychologist. He was the guy, the other physiological
psychologist. His name is Gary Deatherage. I had written to Lethbridge and
Roger Barnsley was the chair. And he, this is unbelievable, I was at the
University of Manitoba giving my song and dance. And it was in the chairman's
office and the phone rang. And he [John, the chairman,] said, “yeah, he's here”.
And he says, “the phone call is for you” and I went, “pardon me?” And he said, “Yeah,
it's Ian Whishaw [from] Lethbridge. He wants to talk to you.” And I thought, “this
is really weird”. So, [John] left the room. And Ian says, “It's not me who
wants to talk to you. It’s Barnsley.” I said, “OK. Why didn't Barnsley identify
himself?” [Ian answers,] “It’s because he didn't want John to know what he was
up to.” John was the chair at Manitoba. OK, and Barnsley said, “Well, we know
that you're going to Alberta. And we know you'll probably go visit your parents
in Calgary, so why don't you come down here too while you're here and give us a
job talk? We don't have the job for sure yet, but I think we will by the time
you come.” So, I said, “OK”. That's how I ended up coming down for the job.
There were only 1000 students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>In the whole university, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The whole university. Really, it was just
UHall. And a little [inaudible] what’s now the phys ed building. That was it.
And so, it wasn't much of a university. The lab, quotation marks, that Whishaw had
was, you know, basically an empty room. There's nothing in there really. A
surgical table. And Whishaw says, “well, we can share everything” and I said, “well,
that won't be [inaudible laughter]”. And so. While I was at Lethbridge, Barnsley
said, “OK”. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh no, I got [to] when I was [interviewing]
at Alberta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, let’s roll back before we...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, I'm making up the dates now. Let's say
I was there on Wednesday. The chair of the department [at the University of
Alberta] said, “well, we're going to meet on Friday, and we'll decide what to
do with you” because they didn't have a job either, they were just so impressed
with this course. OK so. He said, “but I want you to call me on Monday and I
want an answer within 24 hours if we want to offer you this job”. And I said, “OK.
That's no problem”. And so then, when I came to Lethbridge, I told Barnsley this
and he said, “OK. Same deal. We'll make a decision while you're here. And then
we want you to respond on Monday.” And so they had met. And they said, “yes,
we're going to offer the job, the jobs is approved now”. So on Monday, I phoned
the UofA. I phoned the chair to see what the story was and the secretary said, “I'm
afraid he's gone camping for two weeks so he can't talk to you” and I said, I
explained this, and she said, well, in those days there was no cell phone, “he's
gone camping with his kids. I don't know where he is”, so I said, “well, I
guess that makes the decision fairly easy”. But I still had an offer from Manitoba
and one at Western. And so, the night that I was here, I stayed on Ian's couch,
and it was awful. But I was talking to his wife. And she says, “what is it you
want?” I said, “well, I'd rather live in a small town”. And she says, “that
kind of narrows it down, doesn’t it?” Because Lethbridge was about 35,000 then,
it was a lot smaller. And there was nothing on [the West] side really, about 10
houses. There's nothing, no bridge. And so. I thought about that, and when I
was back in Montreal, I said to my wife, “what should we do?” And she said, “well,
we're going to Alberta”. And I said, “OK. Well, I think a bird in the hand is
worth two in the bush because we don't know what [the University of] Alberta
will do. So, we're going to Lethbridge.” When the Chair of Alberta got back, he
phoned me and he said, “oh sorry, I forgot all about it. Of course we're
offering you the job, so just tell Lethbridge you're not going there.” And I
said, “no, I don't know what else you might not come through with, right? So,
I'm going to Lethbridge.” So, that's how I ended up here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, you know, when Ian and I started here, there
was a postdoc here, called Tim Schallert, that was working [inaudible] so for
that first summer, Schallert is still here, and we did quite a few experiments.
And then I taught the course neuropsychology for the first time. And I was sort
of writing it out [as I went, how] the course would be. And then I thought, you
know, there's no book. I should write a book on neuropsychology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, actually, if you don't mind, because
that would be the next question, but I just want to backtrack a little bit to
fill in certain gaps. You also, apart from Western, UofA and Manitoba, you also
had an offer from Brenda Milner. Is that correct?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That's correct. Yeah, she wanted me to
stay. She was really angry that I was going to leave. Well, she only had
promised me one year and we've never discussed anything about it, you know? Now
it's in like April and I told her, [inaudible] she said, “you can't leave” and
I said, “well, no I'm going to leave”. So she was really angry and she said
something like, I'm paraphrasing, “If you want to go study grasshoppers in
T-mazes, go ahead and do it. And see if it's the end of your career.”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh wow. That's pretty brutal.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And she stomped out. She was really quite
angry. And so. OK. I guess I'll study grasshoppers in T-mazes. And there was a
guy. He was Gordon Winocur, who had been in Saskatchewan and I saw him at a meeting
before I came [to Lethbridge]. He says, “you know what they say? It's publish
or prairies.” I said, “whatever”. Yeah, I've reminded him of that. He remembers
it and he just laughed and said, “well, I guess I was wrong”. So yeah, Brenda
was against it. But she warmed up to it. She accepted it. Then, I was writing
papers for her. And so. We became, actually we became really close friends for
the next 47 years. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, well, I guess back to the textbook
now. Well, I mean maybe this is because I did my undergrad at McGill as well,
in neuroscience, and over there the principles of neuropsychology were drilled
into us as though it was the most foundational knowledge in our disciplines. So,
it was a surprise to me when I learned that a textbook for that didn't exist
until 1980 when you and Whishaw have co-authored this book “Fundamentals of
human neuropsychology”. So yeah, please elaborate.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, Ian and I were going to Vancouver to
the Canadian Psychological Association meeting. In those days, CPA was a big
meeting. It’s just now, there's nobody doing brain [at the conference] anymore,
it’s all become clinical. But anyway, we were driving to Vancouver and I said,
“I've got an idea. You're going to help me write a book in neuropsychology.” He
said, “I don't know anything about it”. I said, “yeah, I know that, but you can
come and sit in the course and learn it”. Because I already taught it once. So,
I kind of had a sense of what’s going in[to the book]. And he said, “you're
crazy”. And I said, “No. You're going to help me because I think that it's
going to be broader than just one person.” And if you look at the book, there's
a lot of basic neuroscience stuff in there. “You [Ian] can write that stuff and
I'll write the neuropsychology stuff.” And so, for the 1st edition, in 1980. Do
you remember what edition you saw as a student? What colour it was?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>If I'm not mistaken, it was green.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You are mistaken, it's not. Looking out
there [pointing at bookshelf]. Maybe it could have been black, or... What year
was it that you were an undergraduate?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It was, I started in 2014.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh, OK, it's probably the 6th edition or...
It’s behind you. Yeah, it had a picture, a face. Anyway, so we discussed it,
and as we drove over to Vancouver, talked a lot about it. And [on] the way back
we talked and he said, “well, am I going to get rich with this?” and I said,
“absolutely not [inaudible laughter] might get us famous because there's no
such book”. So, he took the course. And the students got quite a semester
because he argued all the way through it. “I don't believe that” and “explain
that again” and so on. So, we did that and then we wrote it. Well, we were
bumpkins and didn't know you don't just write a book, you get a contract first.
Well, we didn't do that, so we wrote the book, took a year and didn't do much
else except teach. And in those days, we were teaching 5 courses. It was heavy
teaching well. And we then decided what we would do is we would Xerox it, copy
it. By Xerox I mean copy it [Dr. Kolb clarifies in consideration for the
Millennial interviewer </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji",sans-serif;
mso-fareast-font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji";mso-bidi-font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji"'>&#129315;</span><span
lang=EN-US>]. And then we would have students use it. And in fact, it's up
there. [Points at some large binders stacked underneath a construction helmet used
during the building of the Science Commons.] It was really thick because it was
only on one side. And we had used [them] at the University of Alberta.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Alberta?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Why there? Because I knew someone who was
on faculty there who did this PhD with Michael as well. And he was really
interested. He'd come down here to give the talk and he was really interested
in neuropsychology. And we showed him the book and [he] said “well, I'll use
that”. And we had it at Michigan. So, Terry Robinson, who was Ian’s first
student here, an undergraduate who was doing his PhD with Case when I was a
postdoc, by that time, was at Michigan as an assistant professor. He used it. So,
what we did was, we gave it to the students. There weren’t a lot obviously, so
we told them they could have it for the course, but they had to give it back,
because we wanted them to write on it. And especially write “means what” in the
margin [the parts] they couldn't understand, right? “Means what” and there were
lots of “means what”. So, then we revised it. The next summer that would have
been the summer of 79. And then we sent it all over to publishers looking for a
contractor and the answer we got from everyone we sent it to was the same one. “There's
no such field. There's no such course. Therefore, there's no such book.” And
Ian was furious with me [and] said, “I destroyed his career”. You know, he's
going to lose his NSERC grant because he wasn't publishing and on and on. And I
just [inaudible] he said, “You know, there's one publisher [that] we didn't
send it to, and that's Freeman”. And I said, “well, we didn't send it to
Freeman because they don't do these kind of books”. And he says, “Well, nobody
else does either. So why don't you send it to Freeman?” So, I sent two chapters
to Freeman. And I got a phone call from a guy called Buck Rogers who had a PhD
in philosophy. So, he was the acquisitions editor for Freeman. [He] phones me
[and] says, “Don't sign with anybody else. We'll do this book.” I remember the
conversation clearly. I said, “we've had a lot of offers” and he said, “no you
haven’t”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>[Inaudible laughter]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>“Everybody is going to tell you what I just
said. There’s no such field.” And I said, “well, then why will you do it?” And
he said, “Well, my next-door neighbour is the guy called Richard Thompson. And
Richard Thompson was the author of the bestselling Physiological psychology
book.” And he gave it to Richard Thompson and Richard Thompson says, “This will
define what the field is. Do it.” So that's how the book got published. It
wasn't reviewed by anybody. It was published as it was. [It was] the students
who reviewed it, which is unheard of. But they did it. But there was obviously
a copy editor because we had to get it in the format that Freeman wanted, but
that's how the book came to be. And the price of that book. It was $18.95. They
were losing money on it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>OK, I'm trying to adjust here for
inflation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I know, I did. It should have been like 30
bucks, and so, we asked Buck, after [the book] came out, we saw him at CFN and
said, “Why are you selling it for $18.95? Are you making money?” He said “no,
we're losing money”. “So, why are you doing that?” “Oh, because we're fishing
for people and we have to have a hook and the hook is, it's really cheap and so
people will buy it and then they may use it.” And he said, “the 2nd edition we
have to make money” and I looked at him and said, “second edition?” He said, “Oh
yeah, if there's no second edition, I'm fired. We've got to make money back. Because
just the artwork”, which they did, they owned Scientific American. And so, the
Scientific American people. What's the word? People who make figures?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Uh, designer or...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, whatever. They did the figures, so
the figures weren't cheap and so that's how we discovered we were going to be
doing a second edition, which ended up costing about 40 bucks. I think
something like that. And then now we're in our 8th Edition, which is every six
years. I don't think there'll be a [nineth edition]. Maybe Ian will be 89,
right? And I'll be 81. I think that's unlikely. Our enthusiasm for that is
fairly low. But because of that book, and the fact that it did so well and
there's no competitor to it. Cognitive neuroscience has now really exploded.
And that's really the field [people are interested in;] we didn't think we'd be
doing the 8th edition. I said, you know, to the editor, “There's no point. The
field that we described in the book doesn't really exist anymore.” And they
said, “Well, we've just been doing the survey across the world, and they still
want that book. It's not cognitive neuroscience, it's neuropsychology and there
is a field also still, but it's fairly clinical, but that book is used
everywhere.” I went to Korea and gave a series of lectures in about eight or
nine years ago. And after the lectures we now have a version in Korean.
Obviously [I] can't read it. I have no idea what's, yeah [chuckle]. That's just
on the basis of those lectures. So, the book has done really well. It's changed
everywhere and there's an interesting story. René Barendregt, who you likely don't
know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He's in geography. He's from Picture Butte originally,
but he did his PhD somewhere in the States and then he was doing a postdoc at
one of the California schools and when he was leaving, people said, “where you
going?” And he was at some sort of faculty event. He said he's going to
University of Lethbridge and somebody said, “Oh, there's two guys, they're
putting that university on the map. They've got this neuropsychology book” and
he showed it to him. And so, when I met René. In those days, we were in UHall
and everybody knew everybody. There’s this new guy coming down the hall. So I
said, “you must be new, in geography”. He said, “yeah”. I said, “well, I'm
Bryan Kolb” and he says, “are you the guy that has this book?” and I said,
“yeah”, he said, “well, apparently you're putting the place on the map”. I just
went, “really? Whatever you say”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That's awesome, and as you were describing
me this whole story, what really caught my attention is how you're using teaching
as a vehicle to both, you know, write textbooks and to convey knowledge and for
your own learning purposes as well, right? So, one thing that I think we miss
currently is the opportunity for grad students to teach, because especially at
bigger institutions, I have never heard of something like that. So, what are
your thoughts on or what could be your recommendations for younger scholars for
gaining some teaching experience?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I think that the time to do it is as a
postdoc. Because now you've finished your PhD. You won't be surprised to know
that when you finish your PhD, you’re ignorant, you don't know much. You know a
lot about something, but not very much about the rest of the field. And in
contrast to when I finished, the field is huge now. It is way bigger than it
was in 1973 when I graduated. And I think I taught at Western. I taught intro
psych there to 350 students, [it] was a big class, in contrast to Penn State
where there were 20. [It was] a really important experience. And I got paid there
and I didn’t get paid at Penn State. [chuckle] So I think the students should
teach as postdocs. One of the reasons that, [at least some students,] have the
comps the way they are. It was because of me. I said, “You know what? [What]
you really need to do is have students make up a course, which they then can
give when they're a postdoc, wherever they are.” So it's[, the comprehensive
exam format, is] gonna be a little easier, but also they'll had the experience
of making up a course. Hopefully not one that, not like brain and behaviour.
You want something different that makes you stand out as somebody who they want
to hire. So that's my view. I think you discover really quickly what you don't
know. When I came here, I had to teach a course called psychrometrics, which is
a kind of statistics. Well, I took it as an undergraduate, but that was it,
right? And I taught abnormal psychology, which I'd never taken. But I'd been
around patients at the MNI. And so, I had [also taught] Intro Psych, Neuro
Psych. And when I was teaching psychrometrics, I remember doing this problem on
the blackboard, we had blackboards in those days [Okay Dr. Kolb, I’m not so
young that I haven’t seen a blackboard </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji",sans-serif;mso-fareast-font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji";
mso-bidi-font-family:"Segoe UI Emoji"'>&#129315;</span><span lang=EN-US>], and
I suddenly realised I don't understand this. And so I turned around the class
and said, “Well, I've just discovered something I don't understand. The problem
I'm doing. So we're going to stop. Right now. And then run this when we come
back on Friday or whatever. I'll have this figured out.” So, when you [are] teaching
you discover what you don't know. And of course, I knew nothing really about
abnormal psychology. I was maybe a chapter ahead of kids in the class in terms
of reading all this stuff. But I think it's really important to do it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Gotcha. And still staying on the topic of
neuropsychology. So, it is kind of a shame, at least from my perspective, that
we're not, as yet, affiliated with a hospital. So, with our deep-rooted history
in neuropsychology and long-term collaborations with the MRI clinic, do you
think that we can expand towards like a University Hospital type of
arrangement?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We tried to do this with the [redacted]
Hospital. And the chief of Neurology wanted us there, but the psychologists did
not. They were threatened by us. People are protective of their patients as
though they own them. It seems kind of silly, but they are right in terms of
doing it. Here we did work with --- there were no neurologists in Lethbridge
--- there were psychiatrists who we worked with. And we did some papers on,
well, one paper on schizophrenics. Another one on kids healed with Tourette
syndrome. But it was very difficult to do because that wasn't their focus of
research. It's clinical practise, right? The University Hospitals have this
focus on research, as well as practise, so people who are there are expecting
to do research. There's no culture of that here. And that's the challenge. The
Kovalchuk's have engendered a culture in part in radiology. Because they do
cancer stuff. I think it can be done using the MRI as a vehicle, [it] can be
done. But again, those guys up there at the MRI are radiologists and they
[inaudible]. There are now a couple neurologists here. And one, Tony Winder,
was keen on it. He's still here, but he just didn't have time. So, I think it
can be done. But I think we need more people who are interested in doing it.
And the sad thing is that we have basically in the department three
neuropsychologists. One is 83, one is 75 and one is 70. We need younger people.
There has to be the will to do this.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, well, hopefully if we have more
people graduating from our department and becoming physicians in the future.
And having the will to come back and have the initiative to do this. That would
be really cool. So, this next question is kind of funny. This relates to the
research that you guys have been doing over the years, especially early
research. I have heard another rumour that the Morris Water Maze was initially
prototyped in Lethbridge. Is that true?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yes, it is. So, here's the start. Ian
phoned Vanderwolf. And somebody answered the phone. And Ian said, “You're not
Case? Who are you?” He said, “Oh Richard Morris. So, I'm visiting Case. Who are
you?” And he [Morris] said, “Well, I just finished my PhD at somewhere in
England. And we're just travelling across the country.” And Ian says, “why
don't you visit us?” And so, he did. And we had him give a talk and there were
four of us at the talk. It was around the summer. And Richard gave the talk on
this task, which we now call a Morris Water task. But it was a task that had
nothing to do with the brain. It’s a learning task and his PhD was in learning.
And so, at the end of his talk I said, “Richard, we're going to make you
famous”. And he said, “what you're talking about”, and I said, “well, with your
permission we're going to use your task”, and he said, “Well, it's in pressed
so it'll be public. So yeah, you can do that. Why?” And I said, “Because we can
look at the effect of lesions in at least three places, hippocampus, parietal
cortex prefrontal cortex in your task.” But we had to modify it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And so, Sutherland came as a postdoc. He
didn't hear the talk, but he came as a postdoc not long after that. Meanwhile
we had got a tank. Was about this big [Miming a ~1 metre diameter circle]. And
we were, you know, fiddling with it. We didn’t know where to put it. So, the
place we did the testing was where the cage washer was. We didn't have the
space down there, and so when Sutherland came, we said, “well, this is what
we're going to do”. So, we made lesions and what Sutherland had to do is to
figure out a protocol that we all use now. So, he actually did that. And we
wrote a paper on this. And Ian insisted on sending it to Richard. As a
courtesy. Richard read the paper and he showed it to people where he was and
immediately, they started doing it and doing it exactly the way we did it. And
they essentially stole priority on it because Richard said, “well, we've got
some comments and so you know, we'll get back to you”. And of course,
everything back in those days was by mail. And so, they managed to write a
paper. And so, both of us submitted our paper to Science at the same time, and
Science said, “Hold on something's going on here. They're too similar.” And so,
they then went to Nature. Well, one of the authors on the paper. I'm not sure
if [redacted] is on that paper or not. He might not be... Somebody... So, [redacted]
Nature took it. And meanwhile we had sent ours to Neuroscience Letters, in
short version, and so they both published the same year, but who’s going to
look at Neuroscience Letters if something is published in nature, right? But
ours, we had a subsequent paper the following year, I think in 83. I think
that's right, not even 82, in which we had a much bigger analysis and then we
had another paper comparing prefrontal/hippocampal [lesions]. It's more
difficult. And I think parietal regions are in that paper too, maybe not. And
then that paper was published. We did a bunch. But yeah, it came from here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Meanwhile, what Rob had done was. So, we
hired Rob. Because my view is that if you're going to make your department
better you hire people who are smarter than you. And you may have noticed that
Sutherland is fairly sharp. And so, we were able to hire Rob. And he hired a
programmer to programme software and the hardware bits to do the recording and
the tracking of the animals and so on. He went to, I think it was [redacted],
and it was [redacted] and he gave a talk there, and [redacted] said, “That's
fantastic. Could we get that from you?” And Rob said, “sure”. And then he went
and patented it. So, we were screwed there as well. Anyway, we were, we were
just, you know, bumpkins and we just thought you helped one another and just
didn't realise the world's a little tougher than that.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, well, thankfully there's bioRxiv
these days.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I guess yeah. Now, we've got these things.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US style='color:red'>[From this point, the
conversation diverges to certain scientific topics concerning learning and
memory, and spatial navigation. If you wish to skip over this technical bit,
jump to the next red marker.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So well, actually, my next question, is
kind of just for my personal interest, if you don't mind. Because, this
research is very fascinating to me, especially for my topic of research. Because
these days the hippocampus is the centre of attention when it comes to spatial
habits, and it's probably the most lesioned structure that you would study
under the Morris Water Maze. But over here people have studied a lot of different
structures. So, going all the way to completely decorticate the animal, the
hippocampi or specific lesion to prefrontal, posterior parietal et cetera. And
we see that they have varying degrees of effect on, you know, both acquisition and
retention of spatial habits. So then, the question is, given this is the case,
does the Morris Water Maze truly allow us to study space by itself or another
way to phrase the question is can we define spatial navigation as its own
isolated cognitive phenomenon?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No, I don't think so. If you, I mean, I
think everything is network-based. We didn't know that in the older days. We
actually believed in localization of function more than we do now. So, I think
that it's more complicated than that. And if you look at chapter 21 in the
latest edition of fundamentals, you can see our thinking about it has evolved
quite a bit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, for sure I’ll take a look at that.
And so. Let's see, yeah, I guess that answers my next question, which is kind
of, based on the functional patterns of activity that we observe in the
hippocampus, that's where we mostly inferred the cognitive map from, right? But
based on the lesion studies as well, there seems to be a lot of discrepancies
between what we observe functionally and what we observe through lesions. So,
then the question was, is the hippocampus special for space? Or is it merely one
piece of the bigger puzzle?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, it's a special piece of that bigger puzzle
for sure. But it's not the whole story for sure. Other structures are clearly
involved, and I mean the problem we have, and you already know this, but I'll
just say this, space is an English word that the brain does not know, right? It
doesn't mean anything to the brain.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Perfect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yes, it's the brain is. It's true.
Everything language doesn't exist in the brain. Memory doesn't exist in the
brain. These are English words we have to use to describe those things, and so
when you take that perspective and say, well, yeah, really space really isn't a
thing, it's really complex. Cognition stuff, yeah, it involves memory. It
involves visual perception that involves all of these things, yeah. Which is
why we did decorticate rats. Who can't learn it? Which is no surprise. Now, but
you know when we did the decortications. I was doing it at Western. People
actually believed that the rat cortex didn't do anything much. So, I remember.
Hubel, David Hubel, who got the Nobel Prize. He's a Canadian. I heard him say.
At SFN that he didn't believe, that he was surprised that the rat cortex could
do anything. He thought it was just there to protect the subcortical
structures. [chuckle] What? And we had our first poster that Ian and I had, the
title was Flourens [French pronunciation] or Flourens in English correct? Most
people never heard of Flourens, but he was, I don't know if you know who he
was, but he was doing lesions in pigeons and trying to see whether or not functions
are localised or not. And that was our first poster, was on decorticate rats, the
things that they could do and couldn't do, right? And the answer [to whether or
not the rat cortex was useless] was no. It was not correct.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, well thank God. Otherwise, we'll all
be out of a job. So, let's see actually, yeah, oh sorry this is not part of the
list of questions, but one of the papers that fascinated me the most, from your
research and Whishaw’s research was, again has to do with the Morris Water Maze
task, where lesion of the hippocampus or I think in that case it was a transection
of the fornix, causes the rats to... So, in an environment where there are
stable distal cues. The animals trained on three of the cardinal points. When
you place them at a fourth point that they were never exposed to, as a novel
starting location, you can still sort of path integration or they form this new
vector in space, going to the hidden platform, but at the same time, if you
lesion, and this goes back to Lashley, occipital structures, then you're going
to see gradual loss of function. That seems to imply that there's a loss in the,
not just the acquisition, but also the loss of retention of the spatial habits.
So, this ability to path integrate, this got me to think that a lot of these
lesion studies that causes deficits in, say, perception, ability to perceive
certain distal cues and etc. How are we able to distinguish a problem of
retrieval of memory due to inability to actually form the memory or inability
to perceive it to begin with?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It's a big problem. Yeah, and I mean, I
think that, regardless of what systems people will say, we've learned more
about how the brain works from patients with injuries than we have in any other
way. The basic framework comes from that. And so, the advantage of humans is
that unilateral lesions produce deficits that you would not see in non-humans.
So that gives us an advantage. So, if you can show deficits in filling in the
blank, but the unilateral lesion, but the other hemisphere still works. Now you
can start to use that to your advantage. But yeah, if you can't perceive the
room. So, if you have a V1 lesion. You're not going to learn the task. Now,
that's not memory. For sure, right? And so. It becomes a real complicated issue
for sure. It's that, and once again, it's because the brain doesn't know what
vision is. It's all over the place. So, all of these things are part of networks
and one of the things I still have trouble understanding is how you can have a
network. Huge networks, for example language in the temporal lobe but we know
the temporal lobe is doing all this visual stuff. What's that got to do with
language? But they're sharing neurons, are sharing regions in their various
networks, and that I just can't...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There's actually. Yeah, kind of related to
that. I thought of an interesting idea the other day, which is. I was talking
with my friend Rui and we were puzzled by this question, which is when you're
dreaming you do not see symbols, as then if you're trying to read a page of
paper, you think that the text is there, but there are no symbolic
representations in terms of letters or numbers, right? And this is like.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That's interesting.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>This is where the sort of language centres
in the temporal lobe, which, you know, presumably facilitate the understanding
of, the interpretation of symbols and translation of them into language. Yet,
when you're dreaming, the visual system or the visual modality seems to
overtake most of the senses, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, I'd say so.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It's like probably the most prominent sense
when you're dreaming. So, it was just very puzzling to us. Like, how do you
make these two fit together?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, that's an interesting observation. I
believe you're right. But it goes back to this whole issue of the temporal doing
a lot of language stuff, so why wouldn't you [see the letters]?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, yeah, that's the thing. Yeah, I
guess moving on. And I swear this is going to be the last question for my own
personal interest. So, one of my favourite stories in neuroscience history is
about Karl Lashley, who went from a practitioner of the Behavioralist tradition
to subsequently questioning the existence of these reflex arts, according to
the sensory response theory. But ironically the Behaviouralist school kind of
emerged in defiance against the traditional school of psychology, which they
found too subjective. I find a lot of parallels between this story and the
emergence of neuropsychology, where neuropsychology kind of aims to bridge the
gaps between, you know, the case studies in humans with lesions in specific
areas and the mapping of cognitive functions in the brain. So now, what I think
might be the next gap that needs to be bridged currently would be how do you
translate lesion studies to functional data? So, one example would be, how
would you explain the discrepancies between place cells, grid cells, all of
those canonical spatial cell types that we observe using electrodes or other
recording techniques and the loss of specific spatial habits under lesion
conditions to various structures.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, that's a tough question. I suppose in
principle. If you could make lesions that were really small, and maybe
reversible lesions, you might be able to start to get at that. But certainly,
in patients you would never be able to do that. And the traditional lesions
that characterised most of my research course are much larger and there's a
reason for that, and that is if you make tiny lesions, even in the Motor Cortex,
animals recover. And it's very hard to see deficits. You have to, really, you
have to be Whishaw to see deficits. [inaudible laughter] Provides all kinds of,
you know, high speed cameras. And all of this stuff. So, my feeling has been
let's get a deficit. And then start backing off. And in one set of experiments,
that I never published, was to say, OK, I'll make a big lesion on this side
[i.e., in one hemisphere] and tiny one on this side and try and find out where
the key areas might be on this side, by making the little lesions. Because if
you're trying to make two little lesions, if they're not absolutely symmetrical,
it's not gonna be easy to do this. And this is the reason we never published it
is that although I kind of made progress, it was clear it was going to take me
a whole career to be doing this and I said, OK, well, let's move on from this because
it’s not going to be as easy as I thought. I think doing those kinds of studies
might work. You know, if you could make a large lesion on the contralateral
hemisphere or posterior decortication on one side even, right? Then make tiny entorhinal
lesions, or paralympic lesions or whatever, right? You might be able to try and
reconcile the two. But it's pretty hard. Yeah, it's a good question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, this actually kind of reminds me of,
I came across a pretty old experiment where they were inhibiting [one] of the
hemisphere[s] after training the rat on some kind of discrimination task. I
forgot it might have been delayed non-matching to sample or something. Yeah, so
they trained the rats, then at some point they just reversed the task rules.
And then, while they did the reversal, they inhibit half a hemisphere. And then
subsequently they taught the rat to learn the reversal with only half a hemisphere
and then after washing out the drug, the rat retained the reversal. But then if
they inhibit the other half that presumably learned a reversal, the rats went
back to prior to the reversal. Yeah, but at the same time, if you just present,
I think it was like one trial or something, the memory goes immediately from
the hemisphere where the new memory was, to the other hemisphere, which was
quite interesting. Right, so I have a hard time believing that the memory can
be “consolidated” at almost lightning speed, right? As far as the brain is
concerned. So, to me it seems like there's a lot of redundancy seen in the
engrams or the schemas, whatever you want to call them. So yeah, I think
there's definitely some very interesting stuff that we can do with hemispheric
lesions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You know, going back to the Lashley issue,
he was apparently the first person to use the word neuropsychology.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh, really?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>When we were writing the book I wrote to Hebb
and asked him where the word came from. Because in his book, “The Organisation of
Behaviour”, there’s a subtitle, “A neuropsychological theory”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Oh right, yeah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And so. And there's the first mention of it
that I could find. So, I wrote to him and he actually wrote back. And he said
that Lashley had used the word neuropsychology, but he didn't think Lashley had
ever published the word. And you see, he hadn't realised that until my
question. Lashley was thinking about neuropsychology, as we now see it, in the
40s.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, he was. I mean, I guess the term was,
wouldn’t have been very descriptive, as it is today, right? As, you know, he might
have been using the term without having a clear definition of what it was. So,
was Lashley’s definition coherent with what we have today?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Who knows? I know that when I went to the
neuro it was the Department of Psychology. And I said to Brenda. Wouldn't you
call it department of neuropsychology? And she said that's redundant.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I see what she means, yeah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Now it's called Department of
Neuropsychology, but it wasn't for a long time because she just thought that
was stupid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right? Yeah, I guess it makes perfect
sense, right? It's like, how can you study those in isolation? But it's
important to make it more systematic, yeah? OK, so I guess now we're going to
go back on track with the newsletter stuff. So, the UofL counts amongst one of
the few universities, in this world in fact, where the Department of
Neuroscience actually exists. So, most of the time we're grouped in with
psychology or Physiology and indeed yourself and Ian started in the Department
of Psychology. If I'm not mistaken.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>They were both chairs of that department
[inaudible] one time and...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>OK, actually how many faculties were there in
psychology?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>We had. Three social psychologists. One
animal behaviourist. Two cognitive. And then Ian and me. I think that's
everybody, but there were ten of us anyway.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>OK. So then, what motivated us to form our
own department?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, we had changed the name to the
Department of Psychology and Neuroscience to identify the fact that we were not
just clinical psychologists. There is a story that's true, and that is we had a
new Dean and he was from English. And I was chair of psychology. And he came
down to see me, and he said, because the Dean[‘s office] was right next to us, he
said, “sometimes you should give me a tour of your facility”, so I said, “sure”.
So, I was, and you know, we were back in the animal areas and so on. And at the
end of the tour he said, “where are your couches?” And I said, “what do you
mean?” He said [inaudible laughter] that's not the kind of psychology we are.
He had no idea. And so, we started thinking. We have to identify that we're not
counsellors. You know, we're, we're... I mean, I was a licenced psychologist, so
was Ian and so was Rob, but that was doing neuropsychology. Yeah so, we added
the name and then when the department, when they built the CCBN for us, and I
can tell you how that happened. We had hired Jeff Kleim.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So I'll back up. I had applied for a Killam
fellowship, so the Killam award is very difficult to get. No one in Lethbridge
had ever gotten it before then only one person subsequent to me has ever got it,
that was Stew Rood in biology. And it's a two year thing with no teaching. And
it’s quite prestigious. And so I talked to the President, said I was applying
for this and he wrote a letter of support, but he said, “I'll tell you what, if
you get it, we'll add another year [of teaching leave]. It'll be three years
and then we can replace you with somebody who could apply for a grant”, and that
was Jeff Kleim, but we didn't have space. And so there was a lab in biology
that was right next to us that wasn't being used. With just nothing happening
in there. So we went to the president. And, you know, said, “We need more space
and it needed to be contiguous with us because you can't be walking down the
halls with rats. Any chance of us getting that space that this other person is
in?” And he told us and I quote, “f*** off”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>[inaudible laughter]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>He said, “You’ll just want something else
[afterwards]. Get out of here.” So we did. You know, don't ask for it and you
won't get it. And the next day he's coming down the hall and he says, “Kolb, where's
Whishaw?” And I said, “he's in his office”. “Well, let's go talk”, and he says,
“first of all, I have to apologise”. We didn't say anything, he spoke, he said,
“I should have been more discreet. But why don't we just build you guys your
own building? Well, the CFI had just been announced. Take the CFI money and build
your own building”, and we looked at him and said, “are you serious?” And he
said, “Yeah, we have to have a partner. And you guys have a company,
NeuroDetective.” And so he knew about the company and so he said the company
can be our partner and I said, “hold on hold on here, we don't have a lot of
money in that company”, he said, “Doesn't matter. You know, you've got these
shells and we just keep moving things around and no one will realise that you
don't have any money to be a partner, but you will be a partner.” We got the
building. And a lot of it was shelled. And in two years we had to make an
addition because we were hiring people and the building was getting used and
the shelf space was now being used and so on. And then when Bruce came, again,
there had to be an addition put on the building.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>But meanwhile, when we moved up there, we
were still in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience. If you have a road
and you have half something on one side and half something on the other side, you
have two things. It's the geographers who told us, “you can't have a road
between things because it won't work”. And so, we had the Department of Neuroscience,
so that's how it came to be. It was partly an accident of geography. If we stayed
next-door, we would have stayed as one department, but we weren’t.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, that's true. Actually, this is kind
of backtracking a little bit, and this goes back to when you first got faculty
here. So, in the first 20 years that you worked as a professor here, the
graduate programme did not exist, so therefore research had to be conducted by
undergrads and some postdocs under your supervision. So, what were the
challenges and benefits of this?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The benefit was that we had to collaborate.
We became each other’s graduate students in a sense, so we would collaborate. So,
when we hired Rob, who was our third [inaudible] we were doing all the
experiments together all the time and that is not so common now because you've
got grad students and mentoring the students, right? And the undergraduates
were prized possessions when they left, because they had done so much research.
If you look at our productivity. When we had graduate students and when we
didn't, there's no difference. You can look at our CVs and see that Ian and I
have averaged about 8 papers a year for 45 years. And it didn't change. In
fact, it slowed things down because now if you write a paper and you're my
student. And you give it to me. It would be easier for me to just sit down and
write the paper. Then we have you do it and then we teach you how to do it,
right? And so, it's a lot more work involved in getting papers written when
you're trying to help a student do it, that's our job and so you do it right
and so you can't just take it and say, “OK, I'll just rewrite It”, because then
the student learns nothing. And so that's the problem with having the students.
So, the benefit was that we didn't have to go through the mentoring of teaching
students how to write because the undergraduates, they weren't writing the
papers. We would write and we had technicians. So, I mean, Robbin was my
technician for a long time. But having no graduate students was not a problem.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, actually on the topic of Doctor Gibb.
So as far as I know, she's the very first PhD student who’s ever graduated from
this university, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sort of, there were three.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Sort of, OK. There were three from the same
year?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>One was Rob’s and I forgot her name.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>OK. So, suffice it to say that, well, she's
now serving as an associate professor in our department. I wanted to know how
was the school of graduate studies formed at this university. And did you have
any involvement?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Let's see how it happened... So, there were
no graduate students in any faculty. And they decided they were going to offer masters
in education. And so, I was asked if I would sit on the committee that would
organise this. And I said, sure. And it was expected to have a small number of full-time
students, but mostly it would be part-time students who were teachers and they
would come in the summer to take courses, and some during the year and some in
the evenings. So, we set that programme up and it was working. And then we had
a review of our department, when it was the Department of Psychology, to see
whether or not we could have a graduate programme. The review was very positive,
that we could have a graduate programme, but the government said no, we're not
funding that. And so, we then, I can't recall whose idea it was, it was not
mine, and it wasn't Ian’s, it was somebody in administration. So why don't we,
instead of saying we want a programme, why don't we have a special case Masters
programme and so each case would be decided on its own and there wouldn't be a
field, so we would have a special case Masters programme that you would be in [addressing
interviewer] and it would be in psychology or if you wanted it in chemistry or
whatever. So, I was on the committee that set that up because I had been on the
education one. I was on that committee and so we had special case for several
years. But the government wouldn't fund it. So there was no funding for it, so
there were no TA’s or anything because we had to fund it off our grants and
there were very few students and most of them were in psychology. And we funded
it that way. And then the university was showing the success, so if you look at
Robbin’s Masters Thesis, it's a PhD thesis. The students really had to do a big
thing. It would really we a PhD thesis that they did, but it was a way of
publicising what we were doing. And so the government said, OK, they would allow
it, they would fund it. And so that was 1990 or something like that. I'm not
sure when it was, maybe later than that, so there was a Masters programme now
and so then they allowed to have it in chemistry, in biology and psychology and
English and so on.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There was no PhD programme. And so, we at
some point, it would have been around 2000 I think, said, “well, why don't we
get a special case PhD?” And so, we went around and the government eventually
said, “Yes, you can do it. But you can only do it in a few fields because you
don't have the expertise.” But we were obviously a group that could do it
because there were a bunch of us. We were doing well and everybody knew us. And
so, the first programme was in neuroscience. And so, Robin and Claudia
[graduated from the PhD programme], I'm not sure Claudia Gonzalez graduated the
same year or the following year, and then a student of Rob's, were the very
first students, because Claudia had done her Masters, with me. And then she
went to do her PhD at Queen’s. And that wasn't working out. And so, she came
back and asked if she could, when we were going to have our PhD programme, if
she could come back? And I said, well, sure. So that had [inaudible]. And of
course, since then, it's got much bigger as you know.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Exactly. So yeah, now going more towards
the future. So, the last decade or two saw the recruitment of a variety of new
technical tools into our research arsenal and with them came more research
directed towards systems neuroscience and then more recently, artificial
intelligence. So, what opportunities will this shift in paradigm bring to our
department? And what are the potential pitfalls that we should watch out for?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, I think the opportunities are clearly
people like Majid. And the implementation of all this really complicated AI
stuff. I’m calling it AI stuff, but you get the idea. All of these things that
they're doing, Majid and Hardeep and other people are doing. And maybe you are
too involved with all this. I think you are, right?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, yeah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So, I think that is going to reduce the
number of animals that are used, reduce the number of rats being used by a lot.
And a lot of people think the future of neuroscience is going to be humans.
More than non-humans. Because of MRI and all the new technologies that are
available now to study human brain. Sam Weiss, for example, from the UofC
thinks that animal work is dead. I don't think that's true. I think that you
guys are showing that it's not true, showing the change in doing all of these
complicated systems stuff. Electrophysiology, calcium imaging, all of this
stuff is where it's going. But where’s behaviour in this? And where's the big
picture? Where's the field? And the thing that I worry about is, I'm not picking
on you or anybody else, but when you start doing all of this and you're
drilling down, what are the big questions that we're asking?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And I'll tell you a little story in just
one second. [phone rings abruptly] If you think about what the question is in
neuroscience, what do you think it is?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Well, you put me on the spot here.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, well, let me give you this little
story. I was at SFN and Sutherland had a poster and he had two students at it,
one undergraduate student actually, and there was a guy from [redacted] who
studied proteins and et cetera. It was molecular stuff, and he was berating and
saying this is a waste of time. This is just stupid. You should be studying, you
know, B52 or studying this or studying that. And I said, “Excuse me, that's a very
interesting perspective. So, you're telling me that by studying channels,
you'll understand how we can have a conversation?” And he said, “you're just an
a**hole”, and walked away.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I said to the students, he doesn't know the
big picture. What are we studying? What is the big question? So, I would say
the big question is how does the mind work? That's the big question. And so,
when you start drilling down, are you getting any closer to answering this
bigger question about Cognition and so on? I would say maybe. But if you don't
keep telling the students that's the big question, they'll think the big
question is how the channel works, and that is a question, but it's not, in my
view, this is the pitfall, that you're losing this big story. So, you need to
have people who are studying that big story. Chelsea Ekstrand being an example.
And Ian and I are examples, I think. Sutherland is an example. I think people
who are from McDonald's, McDonald is also a psychologist, he did his PhD in
McGill with Norm White. Anyways, I think that that's the pitfall, right? We
can't have a Department of Molecular Biology. It's gotta have the breath and
when the rubber hits the road it's all about behaviour. The brain’s job is to
produce behaviour, yeah? So, I think that's the issue for the future.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>And I completely agree with you, because,
well, that was going to be my next question, because I’m sure you have felt
that academia has changed so much in the past couple of decades or so. And so,
it went from this sort of niche field of study to this massive research
programme and overtime, as this happened, you have a lot more competition, a
little more career uncertainties, that I myself can feel this as a PhD student
in this era. And also, there's a strong emphasis on results over education.
Actually, a lot of my colleagues kind of, I would say, are kind of divided into
the more pragmatic camp versus the people who are more, I would say, interested
in more abstract and less pragmatic questions, and there's even some stigma
attached to that these days. So, what advice do you have for young researchers
who are passionate about pursuing academia in this day and age?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I think that. We've already talked about
the need to teach, as a step you've got to have. Because it really just force
you to have a bigger perspective for sure. And I think that we need to make
sure that the students of the future are clearly thinking the way you're
thinking, that is looking at bigger pictures, bigger questions. What's this all
about? And I'm doing this little bit, but it's just a little bit of a huge
thing. I think that's going to define, it's going to identify the students who
do well versus not. So, well, because the problem is, if you think about it, even
when I started as a professor here, the field was just beginning and the stuff
that we're doing now we couldn't have imagined because the technology wasn't
there. It's going to keep growing, right? The technology. And you need to be
able to shift. And if you have been so focused on one picayune thing, you might
not be able to shift very easily to other questions to take advantage of the
technology that's there. That worries me.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>It's also, I mean, concerning this, we can kind
of use physics as an example of how the field might shape up to be in future,
right? Because if you look at how most of the physics paper these days are, the
ones about not theoretical physics but practical physics, experimental physics,
you have like a million authors in there, right? And that says something about
the division of labour there. Where, you know, traditionally, these big
pictures, these big questions that everybody studying psychology and
neuroscience should know about, had kind of been allocated into the discrete
tasks that they are, right? You have the person who does the analysis. The
person who studies behaviour, who runs the experiments and the person who takes
charge of the theories. But to me, I think this might be too early for
neuroscience, because we are such a young science. We haven't arrived at a
point where we can actually have this clear division of labour, because
otherwise, the pieces cannot fit together really well. Because we don’t have a
strong foundation in our field.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>There's an element of that for sure, yeah.
Yeah, I think that there is more and more of that with multiple authors, but I
still think unique people who. I don't want to call it the top of the pyramid,
but I will. Who actually understand the whole pyramid. So that they can help
direct where the research is going from a point of view, a place of
understanding the big questions, yeah? And I worry that, you know, some of the
people that we might encounter at meetings and so on, are so oblivious to the
big questions. That’s not going to serve them well.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right, I completely agree. So as our
department slowly expands and diversifies, what advice do you have for
students, faculty, staff and admin to welcome the changes but also all the
while retaining the recipes of success that yourself and Ian have crafted? It's
kind of related to the previous questions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah, I think the answer is the same. It's
the breath. And the importance of having people who are looking at the big
story. And in a sense, probably honking our own horn here, but our book, our
neuro psych book really is an example of the whole thing, and it's all there.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yeah exactly, because these days everyone
is kind of taking these abstract theories, and there are a lot of them out
there, and kind of focusing on the discrete aspects of it, right? Using very
sharp, precision instruments for investigating specific stuff. And I think the
field can definitely benefit from a more consolidated way of you viewing the
problem, yeah?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Yes, that's a good word, yeah.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>So then after you retire, what do you? What
will you do?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You see what's on the board there? [points
at whiteboard mounted next to his desk, where around two dozen names/topics are
inscribed] Those are papers I have to write. And you see three that are already
checked off. There's another one I can cheque off now. Two more can cheque off
actually. I'll be writing, I'll still be here. I won't be teaching. I won't be
doing admin. But I'll be doing the stuff that I want to do. And the thing I
like most about research is discovering stuff, yeah? It's exhilarating. The first
person to see this. This is cool. And I hope to still be able to [make these
discoveries], as I'm writing these papers. Some of these, I just had one
accepted that is 20 years old. A student who's now principal at LCI, I think,
high school. She obviously was never going to write the paper. The paper that I
wrote last summer from her thesis was not what we would have written 20 years
ago, but I was able to take advantage of all that time and all this new stuff
we've learned to make it a different paper. And I'm hoping that I can do that
with a lot of these papers and take advantage of the fact that... Well, a lot
of them are 10-15 years old. And just because students didn't write them. And
they left and the papers were never written, which is too bad. And I think I
feel an obligation to the taxpayers who paid for it, and also to the animals
who we took advantage of, to write the papers. And I love writing so. But I still
plan to be looking in the microscope and looking at things. So that's the plan.
So, as you may know, [I spend] at least three days a week in Fernie. We have a
farm there. I'll be able to probably spend another day there. And the travel
back and forth could be more flexible, because of the weather and various
things. Whereas now have to be here, right? And I'm here usually now 4 days. We
will come Monday and leave Thursday.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Right. Do you have plan to supervise more
students?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>No, I'm not allowed. I'm not allowed to,
but I can co-supervise. Yeah, I would do that, largely with Majid probably. But
no, I won't actually be taking any students. I still have one PhD student who
you probably have never met. Have you ever met Loney Harker? She's Robbin’s and
my PhD student. She's older. She's teaching, she's been teaching for us for a
couple of years. She still hasn't finished her thesis. We're hoping it's done
by Christmas. But other than that, no, I won't. You probably know Russell, and
Russell was going to be the last student. But he's decided that for now nursing
is his career and he's...</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>[The interviewer and Bryan went on to chat
about students for some time.]</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I did not make a mistake coming here. And
the place has grown, obviously. They were talking about closing it around 1980,
because there were no students.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>You mean the university? Oh yeah, Adam just
mentioned to me this morning that that was the case. So, were you involved in
sort of rescuing the university as well?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 2</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>I can tell you a story, and nobody else can
verify, but I'm telling you it's true. I was at a dinner, celebration of
somebody getting an award. Michael Meaney from McGill. And I was assigned
seating for this dinner and there was maybe, I'll say 20 people out. It was a
small [dinner] put on by Heritage Foundation and I was walking around and
looking for my name tag. Beside Peter Lougheed was my name. Well, he was my
hero, as he started Heritage and [was the] premier [of Alberta], you know?
Yeah, Rhodes Scholar all this stuff. So I said, “Excuse me Mr. Lougheed. I'm Bryan
Kolb.” And he said, “Yeah, I know who you are. Sit down.” And I went, “Oh,
really? That’s because you knew my dad?” And he said, “yeah, I did”. My dad was
in the oil business in Calgary and everybody knew him because he was there at the
beginning. But he said, “but that's not the reason I know who you are”. “Can I
ask you why you know who I am?” He said, “you know, we were thinking of closing
the University of Lethbridge”, and I said, “I know that”, and he said, “we
didn't”. I said, “I know that too”. He said, “you know why?” and I said “no”,
he said, “well, it turns out we were told there were a couple of guys who were
changing the place and we thought we'd give you a chance”. Right? So I went,
“holy sh*t!” So, we had something to do with it because we were I guess putting
the place on the map.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Speaker 1</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>That's an amazing story.</span></p>
